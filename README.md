# XULABOTB2024
The following code is a combination of Swift for UI implementation and Python for AI implementation. The following dependencies are required for this project, OpenAI API, Python, and Swift. The Python files' names describe their purpose, with one being a helper chatbot and the other being a Chat engagement/moderation bot for the NFL live chat. The files in Swift are to be used in Xcode to see the UI/UX we were targeting for this experience. This app's design is under the assumption that play-by-play and live data are NOT restricted and belong to the NFL or the public. The AI in this project's full version would connect to the swift implementation, but due to time constraints, we have them working separately.
